# Explanation of Changes

This git diff indicates that a new file called `quiz_35.py` was added to the repository. 

The new file contains a Python class named `Solution` with a method named `searchInsert`. This method takes two parameters: `nums` which is expected to be a list of integers, and `target`, which is expected to be an integer. 

The code is an implementation of a binary search algorithm, which seeks to find the position of a target value within a sorted array (or list, in this case). 

In the method, two pointers are initially set at the start (`left`) and end (`right`) of the list. Then it enters a loop which continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Within each round of the loop, the `mid` point of the remaining list is calculated, and then three scenarios are checked:

1. If the value at the `mid` index in `nums` is equal to `target`, the method returns `mid`, indicating the position of `target` in the list.
2. If the value at `mid` is less than `target`, `left` is moved to `mid + 1`, so search will continue on the right half of remaining items.
3. If the value at `mid` is greater than `target`, `right` is moved to `mid - 1`, so search will continue on the left half of remaining items. 

If the loop completes (i.e., `target` is not found in the list), the method finally returns `left` which would point to the position where `target` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.
