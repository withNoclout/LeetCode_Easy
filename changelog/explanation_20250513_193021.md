# Explanation of Changes

This git diff output shows that a new file called `quiz_58.py` was added to the repository. The changes added the class `Solution` with a method `lengthOfLastWord`.

The `lengthOfLastWord` function takes a single string argument `s` and returns the length of the last word in that string. This is done by calling the `split` function on the input string which splits it into a list of words (by default, this function splits on spaces), and then returning the length of the last element of this list (accessed via `sl[-1]`). This allows it to determine the length of the last word in a string.

If we take a closer look at the code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        sl = s.split()
        return len(sl[-1])
```
From this git diff, we see the file was added from scratch (note the `new file mode 100644` and `index 0000000..629adfb` lines), so no previous versions of this file exist in the repository.

Also note, the function doesn't handle the case where the string does not have any words (i.e., it's empty or only consists of white space characters). In such cases, this function will throw an `IndexError`.
